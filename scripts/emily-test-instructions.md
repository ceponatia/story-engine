## ðŸ”§ Technical Validation

### **Files Modified**:

1. **`/lib/prompts/templates.ts`** - Enhanced romance template
2. **`/app/actions/llm.ts`** - Response validation and formatting
3. **`/lib/config/response-validation.ts`** - New configuration system

### **Key Improvements**:

```typescript
// Enhanced Romance Template
CRITICAL RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. NEVER write dialogue, actions, or thoughts for {{userName}}
2. Limit responses to EXACTLY 1-2 well-formatted paragraphs maximum
3. Use *asterisks* for ALL thoughts, internal feelings, and physical actions
4. Only respond as {{character.name}} - wait for {{userName}} input before continuing
5. If tempted to speak for {{userName}}, end response immediately

// Response Validation
max_tokens: 200,  // Reduced from 500
stop: ["[USER:", "User:", "\nUser", "{{characterName}}:", "\n\n\n"]

// Automatic Formatting
formatted = formatted.replace(actionPattern, (match) => {
  if (!match.includes('*')) {
    return `*${match}*`
  }
  return match
})
```
